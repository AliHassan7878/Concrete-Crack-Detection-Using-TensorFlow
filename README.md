# Concrete Wall Crack Detection

## Overview
Developed a computer vision system to automatically detect cracks in concrete walls using deep learning, improving structural inspection efficiency and safety using drone camera.  
The project covered the full lifecycle from requirements gathering to testing and demonstration.

## Features
- Automated detection and classification of cracks in concrete surfaces.    
- Generates visual reports highlighting defect locations.  

## Technologies
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  

## My Role
- Led requirements analysis, model design, training, and evaluation.  
- Implemented data preprocessing and augmentation pipelines.  
- Conducted system testing, validation, and demonstration.  

## Results
- Reduced manual inspection time significantly.  
- Enabled remote teams to analyze structural integrity without on-site presence.
